abstract: |
  This study investigates the application scope of seven existing empirical formulas for assessing the bond strength of various FRP bars in concrete, including normal, high-strength, and ultra-high-strength concrete. Using a dataset of 1019 pull-out test specimens from 34 studies, the paper evaluates formula performance, introduces safety probability values, and proposes safety coefficients to broaden applicability for modern FRP materials and concretes.

summary: Evaluates bond strength formulas for FRP bars in concrete using a large test dataset and proposes safety coefficients for broader applicability.
