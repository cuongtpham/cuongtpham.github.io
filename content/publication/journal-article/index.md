abstract: |
  This study investigates the application scope of seven existing empirical formulas for assessing the bond strength of various FRP bars in concrete, including normal, high-strength, and ultra-high-strength concrete. Using a dataset of 1019 pull-out test specimens from 34 studies, the paper evaluates formula performance, introduces safety probability values, and proposes safety coefficients to broaden applicability for modern FRP materials and concretes.

summary: Evaluates bond strength formulas for FRP bars in concrete using a large test dataset and proposes safety coefficients for broader applicability.

  This study proposes a deep learning framework for automated bridge component classification from inspection images. The approach leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify and label multiple structural elements under varying environmental conditions. Results demonstrate improved accuracy over traditional image-processing methods, showing potential for enhancing inspection efficiency and consistency.

summary: Deep learning approach for automated classification of bridge components in inspection imagery.
