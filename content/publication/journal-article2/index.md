abstract: |
  An innovative framework that integrates convolutional neural networks with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for enhanced bridge component classification and damage detection is proposed. By leveraging high-resolution UAV imagery and advanced machine learning techniques, this approach addresses critical challenges in structural assessment within complex environments. Detailed datasets were collected from bridges in several regions of Vietnam to validate the framework. A fully convolutional network (FCN) was developed, achieving state-of-the-art results. For bridge component classification, the model delivered an overall accuracy of 94.3%, mean IoU of 84.7%, precision of 90.4%, recall of 92.9% and F1 score of 91.5%. For damage detection, the FCN achieved an accuracy of 98.7%, mean IoU of 88%, precision of 92.2%, recall of 94.5% and F1 score of 93.3%. The FCN demonstrates significant potential for transforming bridge maintenance practices by providing a scalable, efficient and accurate solution for infrastructure monitoring.

summary: UAV + deep learning framework for automated bridge component classification and damage detection with state-of-the-art performance.
