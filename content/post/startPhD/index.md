My research focuses on:  
- 🌊 **Coastal hazard modeling** — understanding hurricane impacts, storm surge, and sea level rise.  
- 🏠 **Flood risk assessment** — integrating wave-flume experiments, simulations with community-scale resilience planning.  
- 🤖 **AI for disaster management** — applying machine learning and deep learning to improve data quality and damage detection.  

This journey marks the next step in my academic and professional career, and I am excited to contribute to advancing resilient infrastructure for coastal communities.  

Stay tuned for updates as I share my progress, publications, and experiences throughout this PhD journey.  

## Looking Ahead
Over the next few years, I aim to:  
- Publish research on **AI + coastal flood management**.  
- Develop an integrated **community resilience testbed**.  
- Collaborate with colleagues and mentors at USA and beyond.
